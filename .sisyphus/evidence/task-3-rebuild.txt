BLOCKER: Cannot execute NixOS rebuild

Command attempted: sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/.nixconf#macbook-vm
Error: sudo: a password is required

Root cause: The execution environment does not have passwordless sudo configured, and interactive password prompts are not supported in this context.

Status: BLOCKED - Manual intervention required

Required action:
1. User must manually run: sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/.nixconf#macbook-vm
2. OR configure passwordless sudo for the 'chase' user
3. After rebuild completes, re-run this task to verify the service

Alternative verification approach:
- If the user has already applied the rebuild manually, the verification steps (scenarios 2-5) can still be executed to confirm the service is working.
